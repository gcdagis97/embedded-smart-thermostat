# embedded-smart-thermostat
A system was modeled to emulate modern HVAC engineering on an elementary level and is included in a report. The software and hardware needed to simulate a basic thermostat temperature-sensing system is laid out for replication purposes. This report also contains details of how the hardware and software interact, the theory and research behind the project, possible improvements of future iterations, fully commented and comprehensible code, and finally the conclusions made as a result.

The system controls physical heating / cooling apparatus by communicating from the Tiva board to a Raspberry Pi. A user controls the system by inputting a desired temperature which activates appropriate heating / cooling apparatus in real-time, aided by fuzzy logic. Live feedback from temperature sensor is indicated through the use of a dummy terminal; PuTTY was used in this case.

Platform: Tivaâ„¢ C Series TM4C123GH6PM, Raspberry Pi 3 B+
